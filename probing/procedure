Firstly, the 'domains' file is the sample set of domains
to be probed and data collected.

Run gen-subdomains to extract all connected subdomains

Run probe-subdomains to check if they have an associated IP address from a DNS server

Run probe-hosts to see if there is content at the recognized hosts


###########
existing-domains is a file with the original gen-domains
run. This is missing a few domains to be run again.

Fixed domains is the list of the domains that were missed from the
first gen-domains run.

Checked for duplicate lines in the subdomain folder with:
cat subdomains/* | uniq -d > repeated-domains

This reports NULL results, telling us there were no repeats.
