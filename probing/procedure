Firstly, the 'domains' file is the sample set of domains
to be probed and data collected.

Run gen-subdomains to extract all connected subdomains

Run probe-subdomains to check if they have an associated IP address from a DNS server

Run probe-hosts to see if there is content at the recognized hosts


###########
existing-domains is a file with the original gen-domains
run. This is missing a few domains to be run again.

Fixed domains is the list of the domains that were missed from the
first gen-domains run.
